Front-end built with React and Vue for seamless UI/UX.
Modular back-end API with error handling and validation

## Tech stack
Built with Node.js, Express, React, Vue, MongoDB, this project demonstrates my ability to design, build, and deploy scalable full-stack solutions. 

 ##What I Learned

- Building **RESTful APIs** with Express and connecting to multiple databases  (PostgreSQL).    
- Developing reusable **React components** and managing state.  
- Structuring code for **scalability and maintainability**.  
- Debugging and optimizing performance in both client and server environments. 

##Future Improvements
- Implementing **authentication and authorization** using JWT and bcrypt.
- Add **payment integration**
